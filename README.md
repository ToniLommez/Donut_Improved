# Donut_Improved
Implementation of the famous donut without the use of math dependencies and with improvements in rendering

Donut now use some define to decide the size and I improved the render by adding a better character sequence

The math.c file has a reimplementation of the cos/sin function based on a 4ยบ degree regression

And as a gift a rendering of a cube (incomplete)
